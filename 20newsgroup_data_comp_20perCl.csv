Does any one know of a decent quality library of routines for
performing 3D graphics modelling on the PC?

Ideally the routines would be embeded in our application program.

Requirements (wish list):
- flat surface modelling (simple phong shading optional)
- ability to plot hidden-line drawings
- Texture mapping -- both procedural and bit map
- modeling light sources (local, distant, and spot lights)
- Ray-tracing
- Radiosity (optional)

Any comments would be appreciated.

How about the GNU people, handing out very good, free software?  I've also
distributed two decent-sized programs myself, the Go player Fumiko (at
ftp.u.washington.edu) and the Genetic Neural Network Programmer CEREBRUM
(somewhere out there).

I've only had time to write these programs because of scholarships and
grants.  The intended benefit to society, or a loophole in the system?

I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video (AVI)
file to an Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC) file. Since AVIs also contain sound,
it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC
file. Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs
using Video for Windows, then converting each DIB to a GIF, then loading the
GIFs into Animator. For the sound, I load the original AVI into WavEdit and
save it as a seperate WAV file. This requires too many steps to be productive.

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline
algorithm, but not tremendously faster.  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster.  This is
all C (on HP PA-RISC the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as
fast as possible, as far as I could tell).  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex.  Definitely the
way to go.

Hello,

We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system
(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.

This graphics program should, if possible, support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):

   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
  
   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available, if the output device
      supported it.

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please
contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place

on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated 
and ones that will give prettier images.

Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are 
going to present a paper titled ""Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains""
which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93 
conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape 
with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be 
presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.

We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, 
and terrain elevation maps (DTM). 
Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can
be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can
be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can
also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.

If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such
data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us
directly :

amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or

Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be

There are several CRT-to-film writers around. Agfa has some, they also might
be called Matrix?, and I am pretty sure other companies sell the same
equipment. You might want to talk to any company in your area that does
presentation slides or offers graphics services. They should have those
machines and they might point you to a local vendor. From there on it's all
a question of money. They units are essentially high res CRTs plus a filter
wheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hook-up.

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!

I think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are
correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,
you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the
uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with
Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your A,B and D drives.

Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think
it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed.
But here's the low-down:

WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you
vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a
/checkout directory, and creates a ""checkout"" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program.

*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't
konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I
""zip"" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit
all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know
(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,
now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the ""run"" cmd)
but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip
file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.

Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful ""unzip""ing
functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new
ver.  (as for now, a good old, ""run-->unzip *.zip"" will work.

(PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).

peace,
Mickey

Hello,

recently I noticed there is a directory named ""DiskImage"" in my disk.  I didn't
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.
I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of
the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Thanks,

Anibal

I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,
show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very
convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university. 
The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the
program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion
sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19
(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
windows program start.

OK, now you are starting to define your criteria.

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that.  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said
earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.
But some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the
other systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer
support, GUI etc.)

[ BTW, I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIX/X is as easy to
  learn as Windows! ]

But I might even agree that, on balance, MSW3.1 is technically inferior to
some of the competition. This still does not prove your point.

Range of available applications? Base OS cost? Cost of applications? Cost
of hardware? Multi-platform support?  Quality of the after-sales service?
Availability of books/training materials? Support for visual and physical
handicaps?  Suitability for use in mobile computing? Quality of
Documentation?

If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on
an OS, or indeed the primary factor, you need to think again.

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good
success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of
people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command
(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear
people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in
Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:

  ""JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if
  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for
  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives
  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use
  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.""

Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I
have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems
that have been ""mounted"" using join.

In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It
wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then
delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.

Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original
*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you
search your disk systems, the document is gone.

I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box
when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg
ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an ""ls"" on the c:\temp
dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to 
reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think
this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw
DOS.

So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like.

Wouldn't it be real great to ""mount"" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main
file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,
JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.

It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was
meant for casual, even ignorant users, so ""mounting"" all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry
this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant 
users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.

It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets

Solitaire, for example).

None that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the

Windows.

If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them
don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it.

No.  This is a problem with the applications, usually.

There are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I
understand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so
there's no way to avoid this entirely.

There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on
the resource pool.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1.
Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being
executed from the DOS directory.

Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not,
I don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE
(which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't
eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in 
about 20 seconds from the ""Starting MS-DOS"" herald to the end of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more
realistic volume of data to time.

One of the things going for the DX2-66 (over the 50) is that it's
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec.

I hope that there's somebody out there that can help us.

Some of our students change the AMI bios passwords on a few of our computers 
and set it for always. What we'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass 
or remove the password. We have tried switching bios, but to no avail. The 
battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under

        I am considering selling an Atari 1040 and purchasing an IBM compa-

the Atari before I bother.  I am about to start graduate school, and that
means I'm about to be poor!  (There's a price list for used synthesizers on
rec.music.makers.synth, but no equivalent list for computers...)

This system is tailor-made for a MIDI musician.  Details follow:

  * Atari 1040 ST
      TOS 1.0
      1 MB RAM
      720K floppy drive

  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old

  * 12"" Atari monochrome monitor

  * Generic 2400 baud external modem

  * Software: All software is registered and comes with manuals.
      Passport's Master Tracks Pro, Version 2.5 (sequencing software)
      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)
      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)
      Megamax's Laser C, Version 2.0 (programming language)
      VIP Professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech Lotus clone)
      Partner ST (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)

      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)
      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)
      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)


        I will consider all prices above $900.  I am also willing to
trade the Atari system for a quality (386 or 486) PC, including lap-tops.
I own some PC hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.

FOR SALE:

AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem

The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer
than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,
v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so
you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone
line.  They will ""fall back"" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with
multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).

I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

Thanks.

Howdy,

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive,
and a high-density 3.5"" floppy.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5"" floppy, which will read, but NOT
WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs.

I have tried everything I can think of.

Any takers?

Call Phoenix.  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.

Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!

Do you mean the ViewSonic 7?  It uses a Matsushita tube.  The Computer

lacking some controls (pincushioning, degaussing, convergence and color).
It was the lowest priced monitor in the test,  and did have good center

The U-B PCNIC (also OEMed by IBM for a while) is the only Ethernet card I

I would like to know as well, since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE
drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old Gateway
386/20), which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive.  The SCSI

>I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the _boot_ drive.

Same here.

Any help would be appreciated, since I intend to install this drive
ASAP; I'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before I start.

All of those things that you've mention can still be accomplished
when the
machine is ""power down.""  When the previous poster said ""power

doesn't mean turning off the machine, it just means that the machine
is
in an energy conserving mode that sucks up least electricity.

  Your source is wrong.  The double speed CD300 is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk.  The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the
CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless
you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.

  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster
reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,
but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.

it (always asks why we didn't buy Zeinth products). Nice guy
nevertheless. We still have two working Sony Color Trinitrons from
1972 and 1974. Older one is on it's second picture tube, but both
work. Now they're relegated to the old 8-bit atari computer and atari
2600 game machinces, as well as our not-that-old younger sister's
Nintendo game machine. Sony doesn't make TV's like they used to
though, the newer Mexican assembly-line TV's are not that reliable or
sharp anymore... Dad also just got a 35"" direct-view Sony (god, the
thing weighs a ton!). :)  Still, where would we be without Trinitrons,
CD players, or the veritable Walkman????

	I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time.  This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the
same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off
screens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning
the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)
the machine is still available over the network.

	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.
Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody
pinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody
logs in via a telnet connection.

	I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter
months; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be as
efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's
not too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.  Not only are you
wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to
get rid of the waste heat.

It is a factory testing slot.  The test rig connects to the connector and

I've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is NOT a

My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have

is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
works with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and

There are two approaches:

1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer.

Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking
for some special thing at a Mac store.

    Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI
chip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2
modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI
performance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O
controller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.

Close, but no cigar.  The LISA was introduced in January, 1983 (at the

Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu (4.2.3 Positioning the SimpleMenu).
The reference is to the R5 documentation.

I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget. Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on. The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and
MenuPopup actions.


Ari.wcChildren:		app

*app.wcCreate:		Command
*app.wcPopups:		menu
*app.translations:	#override \n\
			<Btn3Down>: XawPositionSimpleMenu(menu) MenuPopup(menu)

*menu.wcCreate:		SimpleMenu
*menu.wcChildren:	one, two, three

Hi there,


  Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event
to another window but it MUST appear in that window....

I have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!!

For example, if I get a program executing:

--------------
#!/bin/sh
read something
....
....
echo $something
....
....
--------------

and if I send the key event ""<KeyPress>a,<KeyRelease>a""
to that window then I will get:

something=a


Thanks in advance.

I don't have a problem with this.  John Bradley has put a *hell*

Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG
code (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have
observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware
and commercial software.  Sam Leffler's libtiff copyright also grants
permission for unrestricted use including resale.

""Commercial""?  There's a big difference between a polite request

I do agree that John's readme file could be a little clearer about

I received similar information/advice about what appears to be the same problem 
Benjamin has (and I still have).
NIS has all the information about the Macs
(I even put explicit entries in /etc/hosts to no avail).
Monitoring with 'snoop' on my Classic, the initial REXEC packet is sent to
the the SUN, which sends something to the correct Mac, but nothing appears
at the Mac.
'rexecd' is number one suspect, but it's more suble than the README suggests and
I haven't yet looked into it further.

I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed

Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization
features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there
anybody has done some similar jobs ?

By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or
Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button....

That will be great if someone can share us what you have done.

From the FAQ:

Subject:  96)! What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]?

        In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,
to be undefined when building some X11 clients:
        _get_wmShellWidgetClass
        _get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling ""-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic"" appears to work.

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch

A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in
ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window
is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. 
At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.

If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after
wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the
same.)

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information
in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5
public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details.

I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15"",200mbDISK is going to cost
/WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  Color makes it not apples/apples too.
Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC
much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and
cost more.  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC.  For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.

Fatal server error:

===========================================================================

Why am I getting these messages when I type in xinit?
Is there a configuration file for X-Windows(like config.sys for MSDOS)?
How do I start the X session( from shell )?
